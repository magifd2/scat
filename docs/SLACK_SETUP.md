# scat Slack Setup Guide

To use `scat` with the Slack provider, you need to create a Slack App and get a Bot Token with the appropriate permissions (scopes). This guide will walk you through the process.

### Step 1: Create a Slack App

1.  Go to the [Slack API site](https://api.slack.com/apps) and log in to your account.

2.  Click the **"Create New App"** button.

3.  In the dialog that appears, select **"From scratch"**.

4.  Enter an app name (e.g., `My Scat Bot`), select the workspace you want to install it to, and click **"Create App"**.

**Note:** The app icon and description suggestions provided below are optional. You are free to use your own preferred icon and descriptions. This documentation serves as a reference if you need guidance.

### Display Information

Please set the following descriptions in the "Display Information" section of your Slack app.

### Step 2: Add Permissions (Scopes)

Once you are on the app's management screen, you need to add the permissions that `scat` requires.

1.  From the left sidebar, select **"OAuth & Permissions"**.

2.  Scroll down to the **"Scopes"** section.

3.  Under **"Bot Token Scopes"**, click the **"Add an OAuth Scope"** button and add each of the following scopes:

    **Core Scopes (for posting):**
    *   `chat:write`: Required to post messages to public channels.
    *   `files:write`: Required to upload files.
    *   `channels:join`: Required for the bot to automatically join public channels before posting.

    **DM & User Scopes (for Direct Messages and user info):**
    *   `im:write`: Required to open a direct message channel with a user.
    *   `users.read`: Required to find a user by their @mention name (for DMs) and to resolve user IDs to names (for log exports).

    **Optional Scopes (for extra features):**
    *   `channels:manage`: Required for the `channel create` command.
    *   `channels:read`: Required for the `channel list` command.
    *   `groups:read`: Required for the `channel list` command to see private channels.
    *   `chat:write.customize`: Required if you want to override the bot's name or icon using the `--username` or `--iconemoji` flags.

    **Export Scopes (for `export log` command):**
    *   `channels:history`: Required to read message history from public channels.
    *   `groups:history`: Required to read message history from private channels.
    *   `files:read`: Required to download attached files.

### Step 3: Install the App to Your Workspace

After adding the scopes, you can install the app to your workspace to generate a token.

1.  Scroll back to the top of the "OAuth & Permissions" page.

2.  Click the **"Install to Workspace"** button.

3.  On the next screen, click **"Allow"** to authorize the app.

### Step 4: Get Your Bot Token

After installation, the page will refresh, and you will see a **"Bot User OAuth Token"**.

*   Copy this token, which starts with `xoxb-`. This is the token you will use to configure `scat`.

### Step 5: Configure scat

Use the token you just copied to create or update a `scat` profile.

```bash
# Create a new profile named "my-slack"
scat profile add my-slack-workspace --provider slack --channel "#general"

# After running the command above, you will be prompted to enter your token.
# Paste the "xoxb-..." token you copied in Step 4 and press Enter.
Enter Token (will not be displayed): [paste your token here]
```

Your setup is now complete.

### Step 6: Invite the Bot to Channels

For the bot to be able to post in a channel (especially private channels), it must be a member of that channel.

*   In each Slack channel you want to post to, invite the bot using the following command:

    ```
    /invite @<your-app-name>
    ```

You are now ready to post to Slack using `scat`!
